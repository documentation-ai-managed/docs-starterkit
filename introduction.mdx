## Welcome to your StarterKit intro page

This page is a template. It ships with the StarterKit so you can quickly see what a finished introduction page might look like, then replace it with your own content.

<Callout kind="info">

Everything on this page is example text. Treat it as a starting point and edit it to describe your own product, API, or project.

</Callout>

## What is this StarterKit?

The StarterKit is a pre-configured documentation site powered by Documentation.AI. It gives you:

- A ready-to-edit docs structure
- MDX components for interactive content
- A wired-up API reference using `openapi.yaml`
- A Help Center area with FAQs, guides, and troubleshooting

You own all the content in this repo. Update the text, examples, and structure to match your needs.

<Expandable title="How this template fits into your docs" default-open="true">

Use this page as your high-level landing page. A common pattern is:

- Explain what your product or API does
- Call out who it is for and what they can achieve
- Link to Quickstart, core concepts, and API reference
- Highlight where to go for help and troubleshooting

You can keep the overall structure and simply rewrite the content sections below.

## First edits checklist (start here)

Use this checklist the first time you customize the StarterKit. Each step points to real files in this repo.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit this introduction page" icon="edit">

  Update `introduction.mdx` (this file) to explain your product or API:

  - Change the title and description in the frontmatter.
  - Rewrite the section headings and body text.
  - Replace example bullets and lists with your own value props.
  - Keep or remove components like `<Callout>`, `<Columns>`, and `<Expandable>` as needed.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update the Quickstart guide" icon="zap">

  Open `quickstart.mdx` and make it your primary getting-started path:

  - Show how to install or access your product.
  - Add 1 clear path from zero to "first success".
  - Include real commands, URLs, and sample code.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define your core concepts" icon="book-open">

  Edit `concepts.mdx` to explain how your system works:

  - Introduce domain concepts, objects, or flows.
  - Clarify vocabulary you will reuse across the docs.
  - Link back to this introduction and to the Quickstart where useful.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Document authentication" icon="lock">

  In `authentication.mdx`, describe how users authenticate:

  - Add how to obtain credentials (keys, tokens, or logins).
  - Show example headers, environment variables, or login flows.
  - Call out security best practices you expect users to follow.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Wire navigation and structure" icon="settings">

  Adjust `documentation.json` to match your content:

  - Rename page titles and groups to match your product.
  - Add or remove entries as you add new `.mdx` files.
  - Keep paths in sync with actual filenames in this repo.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your API reference" icon="code">

  Replace `openapi.yaml` with your own OpenAPI description:

  - Ensure the file is valid OpenAPI.
  - Keep the filename `openapi.yaml` so the API Reference tab continues to work.
  - Use tags and descriptions to keep your reference readable.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize the Help Center" icon="help-circle">

  Update the Help Center content under the `help-center` folder:

  - `help-center.mdx`: overview of support and resources.
  - `help-center/faq/getting-started.mdx`: common onboarding questions.
  - `help-center/troubleshooting/install-error.mdx`: adapt to your real issues.
  - `help-center/guides/setup-project.mdx`: turn into a real setup guide.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Starter layout you can reuse

The sections below show common patterns you can keep and adapt. Replace the text to describe your own product.

### Example: high-level feature overview

Use cards in a grid to highlight a few core capabilities.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Explain your product" icon="book-open" href="#welcome-to-your-starterkit-intro-page">

  Summarize what your product or API does in one or two short sentences. Link back to this intro section if helpful.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Show how to get started" icon="zap" href="/quickstart">

  Point new users to your Quickstart so they can install, configure, or make their first request in a few minutes.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Teach key concepts" icon="database" href="/concepts">

  Introduce the concepts and mental models users need before they dive deep into your API or SDKs.

  </Card>
</Columns>

### Example: call out how to use your API

Use tabs or a code group to show language variants for the same task, such as making a basic request.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
// Example: replace this with your real API call
// Show the simplest working request a new user should make.
const response = await fetch("https://your-api.example/v1/endpoint", {
  method: "GET"
})
const data = await response.json()
console.log(data)
```

```python
# Example: replace this with your real API call
# Show the simplest working request a new user should make.
import requests

response = requests.get("https://your-api.example/v1/endpoint")
data = response.json()
print(data)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">

Replace the placeholder URL and request details above with a real example that matches your API. If you do not need multi-language examples, you can delete the whole `CodeGroup`.

</Callout>

### Example: expandable "about" section

Give readers a quick summary and let them open details when they want to learn more.

<Expandable title="How to adapt this section" default-open="false">

- Rename the heading to match your use case.
- Replace this list with details about your product, pricing model, or architecture.
- Add links to your Concepts, API Reference, or Help Center where they provide deeper context.

</Expandable>
