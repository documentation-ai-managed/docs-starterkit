## Overview

<Callout kind="alert">
This site ships with placeholder content. Use this quickstart to replace it with your real product docs.
</Callout>

## 1. Update a page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit introduction.mdx" icon="edit">
    Replace the sample introduction with a concise overview of your product and the key actions you want new users to take first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview your change" icon="monitor">
    Use your usual preview workflow (local dev server or hosted editor) to confirm the updated introduction looks and reads as expected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

title: Your First Page
description: Replace this with your own summary.

## Your First Page
Write the content you want users to read first.
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register in navigation" icon="settings">
    Add a new page entry in `documentation.json` so your page appears in the sidebar and tab navigation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example onboarding flow (replace with yours)

1. Sign up for an account and verify your email.
2. Create your first workspace, project, or environment.
3. Add one integration or data source to connect your existing tools.
4. Complete a guided action (for example, run your first job or publish your first resource).
5. Invite a teammate and assign a basic role or permission.

## 3. Connect API Reference (optional)

If you have an API, replace `openapi.yaml` with your real OpenAPI file. If you do not need an API reference, remove that tab from `documentation.json`.
