title: Quickstart
description: Set up the docs repo locally, edit your first page, add a new page, and register it in documentation.json.
---

## Overview

This quickstart walks you through:

- Running the documentation site locally
- Editing the existing `introduction.mdx` page
- Adding a new page file
- Registering the new page in `documentation.json`
- Optionally wiring API Reference routes from `openapi.yaml`

If you are new, you may also want to read the [Introduction](/introduction).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Node.js and npm or yarn installed
- Git installed
- Access to this docs repository on your machine

If your project provides a specific Node.js version or package manager in its README, prefer those versions.

<Callout kind="info">

All paths and filenames in this quickstart assume you are in the root of the docs repository that contains:

- `introduction.mdx`
- `quickstart.mdx`
- `documentation.json`
- `openapi.yaml`

</Callout>

## Run the docs locally

Use your package manager to install dependencies and start the local dev server.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">

Run the following from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the dev server">

Then start the documentation server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open the printed local URL in your browser. You should see the documentation with a **Documentation** tab containing **Getting Started** with **Introduction** and **Quickstart**.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Edit the introduction page

Next, make a small change to confirm that local edits are reflected in the browser.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open introduction.mdx">

From the repo root, open the file:

```bash
code introduction.mdx
# or use your preferred editor
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Make a visible change">

Add or change a line in the body, for example:

```mdx
## Welcome

This is a local edit to the Introduction page.
```

Save the file and check the browser. Hot reload should apply your change immediately.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add a new page file

Now add a completely new page and wire it into the navigation.

In this example, you will create a page called `My First Page`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the MDX file">

From the repository root, create a new file named `my-first-page.mdx`:

```bash
touch my-first-page.mdx
```

Open `my-first-page.mdx` and add minimal frontmatter and content:

```mdx
---
title: My First Page
description: Example page added in the quickstart.
---

## My first page

This is a new page created during the quickstart.

You can add headings, text, and code blocks here as needed.
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Register the page in documentation.json

The site navigation is defined in `documentation.json`. To make your new page appear in the **Documentation** tab, add an entry that points to the new file.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open documentation.json">

From the repo root, open:

```bash
code documentation.json
```

Locate the **Documentation** tab and the `Getting Started` group. It contains existing pages such as `introduction` and `quickstart`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a page entry">

Inside the `Getting Started` group, add a new page object for `My First Page`. For example:

```json
{
  "tab": "Documentation",
  "icon": "book",
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "Getting Started",
      "icon": "rocket",
      "pages": [
        {
          "title": "Introduction",
          "path": "introduction",
          "icon": "home"
        },
        {
          "title": "Quickstart",
          "path": "quickstart",
          "icon": "zap"
        },
        {
          "title": "My First Page",
          "path": "my-first-page",
          "icon": "file-text"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Adjust indentation to match your existing file. The important fields are:

- `"title"`: Label shown in the sidebar.
- `"path"`: Base filename of your MDX file, without extension.
- `"icon"`: An icon name used by your navigation (for example `file-text`).

Save `documentation.json`, then reload the browser. You should now see **My First Page** in the **Getting Started** section.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

You can reuse existing icon names from other entries in `documentation.json` if you are unsure which icon to pick.

</Callout>

## Optional: Connect API Reference from openapi.yaml

The **API Reference** tab in navigation uses the `openapi.yaml` file to generate endpoint docs.

If you need to update API Reference:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the OpenAPI file">

From the repo root, open:

```bash
code openapi.yaml
```

You should see a standard OpenAPI document with paths and components.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add or update an endpoint">

Follow your API team guidelines when editing OpenAPI. A very simple path entry might look like:

```yaml
paths:
  /health:
    get:
      summary: Health check
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Service is healthy
```

After saving changes, restart the dev server if needed so your API Reference reflects the updated `openapi.yaml`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

You have now:

- Run the docs site locally
- Edited an existing page
- Added a new page file
- Registered it in `documentation.json`
- Learned where API Reference comes from via `openapi.yaml`

From here, you can:

- Refine the content of your [Introduction](/introduction)
- Organize more topics under new groups in `documentation.json`
- Expand the API Reference by enriching `openapi.yaml`
