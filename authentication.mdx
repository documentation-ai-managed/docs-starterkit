title: Authentication (Sample)
description: Sample guidance for authentication and OpenAPI usage.

## Overview

This is sample content. Replace tokens, URLs, headers, and flows with your real authentication requirements.

This API uses OpenAPI to describe endpoints, parameters, and responses. The reference is generated from `openapi.yaml`, so keep that file up to date as your API evolves.

## Authentication

Use a bearer token in the `Authorization` header for authenticated requests.

```bash
curl https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/example \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

<ParamField header="Authorization" param-type="string" required="true">
  `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
</ParamField>

## Using the API reference

Use the API reference to explore endpoints, required parameters, and example responses. If you update authentication headers or base URLs, also update `openapi.yaml` so the reference stays accurate.

## Common mistakes
